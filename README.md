First programming coursework from University. 
The provided C code implements a text-based adventure game where players navigate through interconnected rooms. It uses a set of structures to represent game entities, including rooms, connections between rooms, the player, and the overall game state. The program reads room and connection information from CSV files, dynamically allocates memory to store this data, and establishes connections between rooms based on the information provided. The game includes features such as room reconnaissance, movement between rooms, and an elapsed time tracker. The main game loop continually prompts the player with a menu, allowing them to explore rooms, move to different locations, or quit the game. The code demonstrates file handling, dynamic memory allocation, and basic game mechanics, making it a concise example of a simple text-based adventure game in C.
